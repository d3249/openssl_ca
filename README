The proyect is currently conformed by two scripts and a compressed file with two configuration files.

This project is intended to be used to quikly create a Certificate Authority (CA) for developing and/or testing porpuses.

The script openssl_ca mainly follows the steps by Jamie Nguyen in his page (https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/index.html) with minor changes in directory structure.

There are five commands for the openssl_ca script:
      prepare - Will extract configuration files in config/ directory
      ca - Will create root and intermediate CA certificates and the corresponding keys.
      server - Will create a key, a crs file and the corresponding certificate signed by intermediate CA. The certificate will be allowed for server authenticaton.
      client - Will create a key, a crs file and the corresponding certificate signed by intermediate CA. The certificate will be allowed for client authenticaton.
      sign [ server | client ] - Will respond to a CSR generating a certificate signed by intermediate CA with given permissions.
      export ID - Will create a compressed file with all files corresponding to the given id.

The second script converts the PEM files to a single JKS keystore file.
